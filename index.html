            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>“Both of my parents had this old Puerto Rican mentality that the most important thing is your family. Even though we lived in the housing projects, I never realized that we didn’t have much money. Every birthday and holiday was a huge celebration. I always felt safe and protected. One of my earliest memories is having a fever and being tucked in by my mother. When I woke up in the middle of the night, she was still there, with a cold rag on my head. That’s just who she was. It was always: ‘What else can I do?’ ‘What else can I do to make them happy?’ And that’s the same way I felt when I had my own daughter. As fate would have it, I received full custody at the age of three. I was managing an electronics store at the time, but I knew I couldn’t be the father I wanted to be if I was working 60 hours a week. So I took a job making half as much money. But when my little girl looked at me and said: ‘I love you Dad,’ money didn’t matter. I wouldn’t get that same feeling if I scratched a million-dollar lotto. I’d have loved to have a big family, but it wasn’t in the cards. It’s always just been me and my daughter. She was my goal in life. I wanted everyone who saw her to think: ‘Wow, she is so well taken care of.’ When she went to school, I studied YouTube videos so that I could do her braids. It looked like a mess the first time I tried. It was just a bunch of hair twisted together. But after a few weeks, I could have opened my own salon. I was experimenting with different styles. And other parents were saying: ‘Wow! Her hair looks so great.’ Nobody knew her dad was doing it. My daughter grew into such a wonderful person. It’s been so wonderful for me to see. But I’ll tell you the greatest reward I was ever given. When my daughter was six or seven, we were playing on the ground playing with her dolls. And my mother was watching us. She was sitting on the couch, and suddenly she started crying. ‘You’re such a good father, she told me. ‘You should be so proud.’ And I still get goosebumps thinking about that. Can you imagine? This woman was my idol. She was the greatest mother in the world. And for her to say something like that, it was like getting a compliment from God.”</p>

            <h3>Mother</h3>
            <p>“My mother passed away suddenly while I was studying in America. It was such a dark moment for me. She had been the most important person in my life, and I wasn’t even with her when she died. I needed to get home to Zimbabwe for the funeral, but it was right before Christmas so every flight was booked. The only ticket I could afford was a middle seat. It was so cramped. I couldn’t even move my legs. But I happened to notice an empty seat in the exit row behind me. The flight attendant allowed me to change places, and I sat down next to a white girl. I remember thinking: ‘She’s going to hate me for taking up her space.’ But instead she smiled and made a joke. She said: ‘Welcome to exit row paradise.’ There was an immediate connection. Right away we began talking about deep things. I told her about my mother. And she told me that her father had also died suddenly while she was working overseas. We started sharing stories of our parents. And before we landed, she ordered two whiskey drinks in celebration of my mom. I spent two weeks in Zimbabwe. I told all my friends that my mother had put an angel on my flight. My trip home wasn’t much easier. This time I had a long layover in London, so I sat down in the airport bar and ordered a beer. And in she walked. God had put us on the same flight once again. When we pulled out our tickets and looked at our seat numbers, we couldn’t believe it. She was seat 61. I was 60. I hadn’t even been looking to meet someone. I was determined to stay single and focus on my schoolwork. But it was like she had been brought to me. Everyone who meets Hannah tells me how lucky I am. She is so kind, and smart, and accomplished. We dated for almost two years before we got married. When I gave a speech at our reception, I didn’t need notes. Because I knew our story. I told everyone about that girl I met on a plane. And I was looking at her as I spoke, and she was now my wife, and it made me so emotional. It was so hard to know how to feel. I wanted my mom to meet her so bad. But if my mom was still here, I’d never have met her. Somehow I’d found the most important person in my life because I lost the most important person in my life.”</p>
